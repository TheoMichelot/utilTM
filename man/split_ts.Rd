\title{Split time series data at gaps}
\usage{
split_ts(data, max_interval, min_ts_length = 0, units = "min", tz = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with columns 'ID' and 'time', and any other
data variables}

\item{max_interval}{Longest permissible time interval within a
time series, in minutes The time series will be split where
there are gaps longer than \code{max_interval}.}

\item{min_ts_length}{Minimum permissible length for a time series,
in minutes. Time series shorter than this will be excluded from
the output data frame. Defaults to 0, i.e., all time series are
kept.}

\item{units}{Time unit (default: "min")}

\item{tz}{Time zone}
}
\value{
Data frame with same columns as input, plus a column 'ID_split'
for the ID of the time series segments after splitting.
